# ☁️ Cloud Resume Challenge – AWS Serverless Project

This repository contains my implementation of the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, focused on building and deploying production-grade cloud infrastructure using AWS and DevOps best practices.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

A fully serverless web application featuring:

- Static website hosting using **Amazon S3**
- Serverless backend using **AWS Lambda**
- Persistent visitor counter stored in **DynamoDB**
- REST API exposed via **API Gateway**
- Fine-grained security using **IAM**
- Automated infrastructure using **Terraform**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **AWS** – S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, IAM
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub** – Version control and documentation

---

## 🧪 Engineering Challenges Solved

- IAM permission misconfigurations
- Region mismatches across services
- Failed Lambda deployments
- API Gateway integration issues

Each issue was debugged, resolved, and redeployed until the system was stable and consistent.

---

## 🤔 Why This Project Matters

On the surface, this is a simple resume website.  
Under the hood, it demonstrates the ability to:

- Design cloud-native architecture
- Automate infrastructure provisioning
- Debug real AWS issues
- Deploy and maintain production-ready systems

---

## 🧾 Proof of Work

Screenshots are included in the `/screenshots` directory to document:

- Infrastructure configuration
- API responses
- Visitor count persistence

This ensures the project remains verifiable even if the live demo is later removed.

## ✅ Key Takeaway

This project proves hands-on AWS and DevOps skills through real deployment, automation, and debugging — not theoretical knowledge.
