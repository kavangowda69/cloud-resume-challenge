# ☁️ Cloud Resume Challenge – Kavan Gowda

This is my take on the Cloud Resume Challenge — a deceptively simple project that forced me to get hands-on with some real AWS engineering.

### 🔗 Live Links
- 🌐 [Website](http://kavan-cloud-resume-bucket-fixed-1234.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com) – Hosted on S3, this static site displays my name and a live visitor count.
- 🧮 [API Endpoint](https://944m4hfjjh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/visitor) – Backed by Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway.

---

### 🧠 What I Did

- Built a **serverless full-stack app** using:
  - **AWS S3** to host the site
  - **AWS Lambda** to handle backend logic
  - **DynamoDB** to persist visitor count
  - **API Gateway** to expose it as a REST API
  - **IAM Roles + Policies** for security
  - **Terraform** to manage everything as code

- Debugged issues, fixed region mismatches, handled IAM errors, and deployed from scratch — more than once!

### 🤔 So... Why is this a Resume?

It's not just about showing my name — it's about showing what I can build.

This challenge is a *resume in disguise*:
> It quietly proves I can deploy secure, scalable cloud infrastructure with real tools used in real jobs.

### 🧰 Tools & Services Used

- AWS (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, IAM)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- GitHub (version control)

### 🙌 Final Thoughts

I didn’t just finish this project — I broke it, fixed it, rebuilt it, and now it runs clean.

This isn’t a tutorial copy-paste. I understand what’s going on under the hood — and that’s the whole point.
