# ☁️ Cloud Resume Challenge – Kavan Gowda

This is my take on the **Cloud Resume Challenge** — a deceptively simple project that turned into a real-world deep dive into AWS and DevOps.

---

### 🧠 What I Built

A fully serverless web app using:

- **AWS S3** for static website hosting  
- **AWS Lambda** for backend logic  
- **DynamoDB** to store a persistent visitor count  
- **API Gateway** to expose a RESTful API  
- **IAM** for fine-grained security  
- **Terraform** to automate it all with Infrastructure as Code  

Along the way, I debugged permissions issues, fixed region mismatches, battled failed Lambda deployments, and re-deployed from scratch — more than once. Every part of this project is now running clean.

### 🤔 Why Is This a Resume?

At first glance, it's just a site with my name and a visitor count.  
But under the hood? It's proof of real skills.

> This challenge isn't about showing *what’s on* a resume — it's about *proving* I can build, deploy, and manage production-grade cloud infrastructure from scratch.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **AWS** – S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, IAM  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code  
- **GitHub** – Version control & public hosting

### 🧾 Proof of Work

In case the live demo is unavailable in the future (due to AWS free tier expiry or cleanup), I’ve included **screenshots in the `/screenshots` folder** that capture every component and output clearly.

### 🙌 Final Thoughts

This isn't a copy-paste project.  
I broke it. Fixed it. Broke it again. And finally made it rock-solid.

That’s why this challenge matters — it taught me how real cloud deployments work.
